# Changelog

All notable changes to fqe. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Semver: MAJOR for invariant changes, MINOR for new features under stable invariants, PATCH for bug fixes.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29

Tag: `fqe-v0.3.0`. Source: github.com/booyajones/fqe. This release adds the two gates the gate itself was missing: a guard against a PR editing its own answer key, and fail-closed config validation so a typo cannot silently disable a check. It also fills the payments QA recipe set and adds a CircleCI path so the gate is not GitHub-Actions-only.

### Added

- **`fqe oracle-guard`** (`cli/lib/oracle_guard.js`, 20 tests). Flags a PR that edits the recorded ground truth or grading rules it is judged by (golden masters, snapshots, partner cassettes, fixtures, seeds, `.fqe.yml`, `coverage-baseline.json`, `stryker.conf.json`, the bypass/reviewer allowlists). With `--include-tests`, also flags a test changed alongside the source it grades, while a pure test-writing PR stays frictionless. Exit 0 clean / 3 FLAG (default) / 2 FAIL (`--block`). The companion `workflows/fqe-oracle-guard.yml.template` requires a second reviewer (not the author) before such a PR can merge. The mutation gate proves a test is strong; this keeps the answer key honest.
- **`fqe validate`** plus fail-closed validation inside `fqe run` (`cli/lib/config_schema.js`, 20 tests, `schemas/fqe-config.schema.json`). Rejects unknown keys (a typo'd `whne:` no longer silently disables a runner), wrong types, and runners that can never fire. A JSON Schema drives editor autocomplete.
- **Recipes**: `docs/recipes/property-based-testing.md` (closes the broken link from the rollout plan), `golden-master.md`, `partner-contract.md`, `oracle-tamper.md`, `flaky-quarantine.md`, and `circleci.md`.

### Changed

- **`fqe run` now ERRORs (exit 1) on a malformed `.fqe.yml`** instead of parsing past the problem, dropping the misconfigured runner, and passing green. This is a fail-closed behavior change: a config that used to "work" by silently skipping a check now blocks until fixed. Run `fqe validate` to see why.
- **`FQE_VERSION` bumped to 0.3.0.** It was still reporting `0.1.0` from `fqe version` and in receipts.

### Tested

- 240 tests, 239 pass, 1 skipped (Windows symlink). No LLM in the verdict path.
- The oracle-guard capability was scored by a multi-LLM gauntlet (technical mode, council): no fail-open or data-corruption flaws, fail-closed verified at the CLI and workflow layers.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-29

Tag: `fqe-v0.2.0`. Source: github.com/booyajones/fqe. The two quantity/quality gates below were the council's Phase-1 priority. They landed on `main` after the `fqe-v0.1.0` tag was cut, so this release tags them and re-points every pinned install reference at `fqe-v0.2.0`. Repos that pinned `fqe-v0.1.0` should bump their `FQE_TAG`.

### Added

- **`fqe coverage-ratchet --report FILE [--baseline coverage-baseline.json] [--patch-threshold 80] [--bump]`** (`cli/lib/coverage_ratchet.js`, 17 tests). The regression-quantity gate: enforces a patch rule (new lines at least 80% covered) plus total coverage never drops below a committed baseline. Auto-detects vitest/istanbul json-summary, coverage.py json, Cobertura, and lcov. Exit 0 / 2 (FAIL) / 4 (INFRA, unreadable report).
- **`fqe mutation-gate --report stryker.json [--threshold 70] [--changed "a,b"]`** or `--killed N --surviving N` (`cli/lib/mutation_gate.js`, 12 tests). The regression-quality gate and the bouncer for AI-generated tests: rejects tests that execute code without catching mutations. Surviving = Survived + Timeout + NoCoverage. Exit 0 / 2 (FAIL) / 4 (too-few-mutants, neutral).
- **`fqe init --with-mutation`** drops in the Stryker glue (`scripts/fqe_stryker_runner.js` + `stryker.conf.json`) and **`--with-qodo`** drops in a Qodo Cover wrapper that uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Claude by default, no new vendor).
- **QA platform rollout plan** (`docs/qa-platform.md`) sequenced from a multi-LLM council review: Phase 1 trust gates (ratchet, flaky quarantine), Phase 2 the mutation-gated AI test factory, Phase 3 payments correctness (property-based, partner-contract, golden-master).
- **Recipes**: `docs/recipes/coverage-ratchet.md` and `docs/recipes/ai-test-generation.md`.

### Tested

- 179 tests pass (`node --test`). The new gates have no LLM in the verdict path, same as the rest of fqe.

### Changed

- Every pinned install/invocation reference moved from `fqe-v0.1.0` to `fqe-v0.2.0` (README, getting-started, faq, qa-platform, the recipes, SECURITY, and the `FQE_TAG` written by `fqe init`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-24

Initial public release. Tag: `fqe-v0.1.0`. Source: github.com/booyajones/fqe.

### Added

- **`fqe run`** orchestrator that classifies the PR diff against `.fqe.yml` and dispatches matching runners as subprocesses.
- **`fqe verdict`** deterministic Node function computing PASS/FLAG/FAIL from runner exit codes + Wilson 95% CI bounds on adversarial stats.
- **`fqe explain`** staff-engineer 5-minute audit. Renders the three architectural invariants, canonical thresholds, current config, exit code taxonomy.
- **`fqe init`** with smart-detect repo bootstrap. Sniffs `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `.xlsx` files, `.vale.ini`, `templates/`, MCP markers. Generates context-aware `.fqe.yml` with commented suggestions per detected stack.
- **`fqe receipt`** subcommand suite (build, write, parse, generate-bypass) producing tamper-evident QA-RESULT.{yml,md} bound to `commit_sha + content_hash + inputs_hash`.
- **`fqe status publish`** that calls the GitHub Checks API via `gh api --input -` (nested JSON body, not form fields).
- **`fqe bypass-tally`** JSONL-based 14-day rolling rate tracker with separate run and bypass append commands.
- **`fqe wilson`**, **`fqe min-n`**, **`fqe thresholds`** utility commands for engineers debugging adversarial stat configs.
- **Engineer-grade failure explanations** in receipt markdown bodies. Every FAIL or FLAG includes plain-English reason, fix suggestion, copy-pasteable repro command.
- **Exit code taxonomy**: 0=PASS, 2=FAIL (block), 3=FLAG (informational), 4=INFRA (neutral Check Run, never blocks), 1=ERROR.
- **GitHub Actions workflow templates** (`fqe-quality.yml`, `fqe-second-approve.yml`) with tag-pinned clone of `booyajones/fqe@fqe-v0.1.0` and SHA256-verified yq install.
- **Auto-detect default branch** during `fqe init` (works on `main`, `master`, `develop`).
- **Three architectural invariants enforced in code**: (1) identity from GitHub Events API only, (2) no LLM in verdict path, (3) no required state only in PR branch.

### Tested

- 162 tests pass (unit + integration), 1 properly-skipped (symlink test on Windows).
- Wilson CI math pinned against `statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint` to 14 decimal places.
- Real GitHub Actions verification: https://github.com/booyajones/fqe-smoke-test/pull/1 (merged, both Check Runs SUCCESS).
- Excel runner validated against external 13,383-formula `vinci1it2000/formulas` test fixture (EUPL-1.1, public).

### Known limitations (planned for 0.2)

These five were flagged unanimously by a 3-judge LLM council before release. They are real architectural gaps, documented in SECURITY.md with today's mitigations.

- **Default install pins to a git tag**, which is force-pushable. Use the SHA-pinned install for production. 0.2 ships a digest-pinned Docker image.
- **`fqe-bypass` label is not bound to the head SHA.** Once applied, it persists across subsequent pushes. 0.2 ships TTL-bound bypass labels (`fqe-bypass-24h`, `-48h`, `-72h`) with head-SHA binding.
- **Allowlist is read at the PR's BASE commit**, not at default-branch HEAD. 0.2 fetches allowlist from `refs/heads/main` at workflow-run time.
- **Receipts default to 90-day GitHub artifact retention.** Check Run output persists indefinitely (with a 65KB cap). 0.2 ships an opt-in post-merge `audits/<sha>/` archiver.
- **Bypass-tally JSONL writes to the protected branch from a `workflow_run` event.** Fork PRs cannot bypass (intentional, read-only token). Concurrency stress-tested to ~5 simultaneous merges. 0.2 moves state to an external KV.

Also:

- **No JSON Schema for `.fqe.yml`** yet. VSCode autocomplete pending.
- **No published Docker image**. Workflows clone-and-install (about 20s overhead per CI run). Once published, swap `container: ghcr.io/booyajones/fqe:0.1`.
- **No `create-fqe-runner` scaffold**. Plugin authoring is doc-driven only.

### Migration notes

This is v0.1.0. No prior version to migrate from.
